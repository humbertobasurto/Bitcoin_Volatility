This Project was made to demonstrate how volatile and always changing the Bitcoin market is and provides an insight as to how safe it might be to make an investment on it. Using the aformentioned API I made a dataset from 2007 prices and take the reader through the steps that were taken to arrive at the finishing conclusion and the analysis/graphs that were used to help us arrive at it.

I made this to show my personal way of thinking, how I used python and what steps I took to try to gain meaningful insight into questions I found myself asking about the dataset.
