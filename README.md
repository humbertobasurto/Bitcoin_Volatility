This Project was made to demonstrate how volatile and always changing the Bitcoin market is and provides an insight as to how safe it might be to make an investment on it. Using the aformentioned API I made a dataset from 2007 prices and take the reader through the steps that were taken to arrive at the finishing conclusion and the analysis/graphs that were used to help us arrive at it.

In this sort of tutorial I try to guide the reader to make their own conclusions as to how safe it is to invest in bitcoin using data from 2007 using an api for tracking coins. This project idea was inspired by DataCamp.
